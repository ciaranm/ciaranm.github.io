        <p>To be held on 19th July 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal as part of the <a href="https://www.floc26.org/program">Federated Logic Conference (FLoC '26)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Background and Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                Modern automated reasoning has transformed large parts of industry and has also found numerous
                scientific applications. But many reasoning problems are computationally very challenging, or sometimes
                even undecidable. Because of this, the algorithms used are getting increasingly complex, and even the
                most mature tools currently available struggle with incorrect results. As these algorithms are
                increasingly being used autonomously, sometimes even in life-critical applications, it is urgent to
                ensure that what they compute is valid. Software testing, while important, has not been sufficient to
                resolve this problem, and formal verification methods are far from being able to scale to the level of
                complexity in modern algorithms.</p>

                <p>
                    During the last twenty years, the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead
                    spearheaded the use of <em>proof logging</em>, meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer
                    to a problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct. Such solvers are also referred
                    to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>. For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger paradigms
                    in automated reasoning met with limited success. This has changed in the last few years, however,
                    with proof logging techniques now being developed for a wide range of paradigms such as SAT-based
                    and pseudo-Boolean optimisation, subgraph solving, constraint programming, automated planning, mixed
                    integer linear programming, and even satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving and automated
                    theorem proving.
                </p>

                <p>
                These developments have been so fast that in 2024 the fairly spontaneous idea arose to celebrate the
                latest advances during an informal workshop, which—reflecting the rather improvised nature of the
                event—was named the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS24/">1st Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems
                    (WHOOPS '24)</a>. The second edition <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS25/">WHOOPS '25</a>
                was held last autumn under the auspices of <a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">EuroProofNet</a>.</p>

                <p>
                The third instalment of the workshop series, to be held on 19th July 2026, as part of the
                <a href="https://www.floc26.org/">
                    Federated Logic Conference (FLoC '26)</a>,
                will continue to expand the range of topics beyond SAT and pseudo-Boolean proof logging to provide
                a forum for discussing certifying algorithms for automated reasoning more broadly. In addition to
                ensuring correctness of outputs for automated reasoning algorithms, we also hope to discuss the use
                of proof logging to provide new tools for algorithm development and analysis, software debugging,
                and even research into explainability in the context of AI.
                </p>

                <h2>Call for Contributed Talks</h2>

            <p>
                The purpose of the third edition of WHOOPS is to bring together researchers interested in certification
                for combinatorial algorithms and automated reasoning. We solicit contributed talks that will be of
                interest to this audience, on topics which could include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The theory or practice of proof logging systems;</li>
                <li>Bringing proof logging to existing or new solving tools;</li>
                <li>Descriptions of challenges anticipated or encountered;</li>
                <li>Integrating proof logging into larger verification frameworks;</li>
                <li>Connections between proof logging and explainability;</li>
                <li>Speculation about or requests for future directions for proof logging and certification</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                WHOOPS does not have full papers or proceedings, and talks may cover work that is already published or
                that may be published
                elsewhere in the future. We ask only for a brief (&lt;1 page) abstract, which can be
                <a href="https://submissions.floc26.org/whoops/">submitted through the FLoC submissions system</a>.</p>

            <p>Deadline: 15th May 2026.</p>
