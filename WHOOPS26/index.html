        <h1>3rd International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS '26) </h1>
        <p>To be held on 19th July 2026 in Lisbon, Portugal as part of the <a href="https://www.floc26.org/program">Federated Logic Conference (FLoC '26)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Background and Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic improvements in algorithms for combinatorial
                solving and optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get increasingly more
                sophisticated and complex, it becomes increasingly hard to avoid bugs sneaking in during algorithm
                design and implementation, and even the most mature tools currently available struggle with incorrect
                results. Software testing, while important, has not been sufficient to resolve this problem, and formal
                verification methods are far from being able to scale to the level of complexity in modern combinatorial
                solvers. During the last twenty years the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead
                spearheaded the use of proof logging, meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
                problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct. Such solvers are also referred to as
                certifying algorithms. For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
                paradigms in combinatorial solving and optimization have met with limited success, but
                this has changed in the last few years, with proof logging now being possible for a
                range of paradigms such as SAT-based optimisation (MaxSAT), Satisfiability Modulo
                Theories (SMT), pseudo-Boolean optimisation, subgraph solving, constraint programming,
                automated programming, integer linear programming, and dynamic programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                These developments have been so fast that in 2024 the fairly spontaneous idea arose to gather
                researchers working on pseudo-Boolean proof logging to an informal gathering, which—reflecting the
                rather improvised nature of the event—was named the <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS24/">1st Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and
                    Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS '24)</a>. The <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/WHOOPS25/">second edition of the workshop</a> was held on
                September 13-14 2025 in Orsay outside Paris under the auspices of <a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">EuroProofNet</a>. In addition to offering a
                healthy dose of pseudo-Boolean proof logging, the purpose of WHOOPS has evolved to provide a forum for
                discussing certifying algorithms for automated reasoning more broadly, including satisfiability modulo
                theories (SMT) solving and first- and higher-order theorem proving. The third edition of the workshop
                will be held on 19th July 2026 as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC '26), again with a
                broader audience in mind.

        <h2>Call for Contributed Talks</h2>

            <p>
                The purpose of the third edition of WHOOPS is to bring together researchers interested in certification
                for combinatorial algorithms and automated reasoning. We solicit contributed talks that will be of
                interest to this audience, on topics which could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The theory or practice of proof logging systems;</li>
                <li>Bringing proof logging to existing or new solving tools;</li>
                <li>Descriptions of challenges anticipated or encountered;</li>
                <li>Integrating proof logging into larger verification frameworks;</li>
                <li>Speculation about or requests for future directions for proof logging and certification</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                WHOOPS does not have full papers or proceedings, and talks may cover work that is already published or
                that may be published
                elsewhere in the future. We ask only for a brief (&lt;1 page) abstract, which can be
                <a href="https://submissions.floc26.org/whoops/">submitted through the FLoC submissions system</a>.</p>

            <p>Deadline: 15th May 2026.</p>
